Step 3:
Added User & Admin roles allowing each to have access to specific sections of the app.

Step 4:
We added the ability to add Twitter & Facebook links to profiles.
I learned how "NULL" and "NOT NULL" work in the schema.
Ran into issues with certain Facebook urls not working. Adding a "/" to the end of the url fixed it.

Step 5:
We added the ability to register as a new user.
It felt good knowing halfway through that my new user wasn't able to see anything because they hadn't been assigned a role yet.
I was starting to understand what the next steps would be before I had gotten to them.
